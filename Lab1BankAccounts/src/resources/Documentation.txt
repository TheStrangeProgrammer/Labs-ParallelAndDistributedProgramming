Each account has a lock.

1. When a transfer is running, the 2 accounts involved in the transfer are locked in
such a manner so that a deadlock is not created.

We lock the source account and  we try to acquire a lock for the target account.
    If this is not possible we, unlock the source account, sleep and lock again the #
    source account. This way, we avoid any possible deadlocks.

    - if the balance is not enough for the transfer we release the lock for the
        source account and the target account, and stop the transfer

    - otherwise, we make the transfer and in the end of it, we release the locks
    form the source and target account

2. When we do a consistency check, we lock each accounts and compute the consistency
check and then we unlock them.
This way, no other transfers can modify the state of these accounts until the consistency
check is over.
